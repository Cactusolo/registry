The purpose of building this germplasm extension for Darwin Core is for the development of an application schema for the GBIF IPT data publishing toolkit. The DwC Germplasm extension could also stimulate a process of further improved compatibility of the terms for documentation of germplasm and the terms and concepts used for documentation in other sub-domains of biodiversity informatics.",

These vocabularies aim to represent information that will help to determine whether a particular resource or collection will be fit for some particular biodiversity science application before acquiring the media. Among others, the vocabularies address such concerns as the management of the media and collections, descriptions of their content, their taxonomic, geographic, and temporal coverage, and the appropriate ways to retrieve, attribute and reproduce them. This document contains a list of attributes of each Audubon Core term, including a documentation name, a specified URI, a recommended English label for user interfaces, a definition, and some ancillary commentary.",
